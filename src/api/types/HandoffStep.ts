     * This is the input to the block. You can use any key-value map as input to the block.
     *
     * Example:
     * {
     * "name": "John Doe",
     * "age": 20
     * }
     *
     * You can reference any variable in the context of the current block:
     *
     * - "{{your-step-name.output.your-property-name}}" for another step's output (in the same workflow; read caveat #1)
     * - "{{your-step-name.input.your-property-name}}" for another step's input (in the same workflow; read caveat #1)
     * - "{{your-block-name.output.your-property-name}}" for another block's output (in the same workflow; read caveat #2)
     * - "{{your-block-name.input.your-property-name}}" for another block's input (in the same workflow; read caveat #2)
     * - "{{workflow.input.your-property-name}}" for the current workflow's input
     * - "{{global.your-property-name}}" for the global context
     *
     * Example:
     * {
     * "name": "{{my-tool-call-step.output.name}}",
     * "age": "{{my-tool-call-step.input.age}}",
     * "date": "{{workflow.input.date}}"
     * }
     *
     * You can dynamically change the key name.
     *
     * Example:
     * {
     * "{{my-tool-call-step.output.key-name-for-name}}": "{{name}}",
     * "{{my-tool-call-step.input.key-name-for-age}}": "{{age}}",
     * "{{workflow.input.key-name-for-date}}": "{{date}}"
     * }
     *
     * You can represent the value as a string, number, boolean, array, or object.
     *
     * Example:
     * {
     * "name": "john",
     * "age": 20,
     * "date": "2021-01-01",
     * "metadata": {
     * "unique-key": "{{my-tool-call-step.output.unique-key}}"
     * },
     * "array": ["A", "B", "C"],
     * }
     *
     * Caveats:
     *
     * 1. a workflow can execute a step multiple times. example, if a loop is used in the graph. {{stepName.input/output.propertyName}} will reference the latest usage of the step.
     * 2. a workflow can execute a block multiple times. example, if a step is called multiple times or if a block is used in multiple steps. {{blockName.input/output.propertyName}} will reference the latest usage of the block. this liquid variable is just provided for convenience when creating blocks outside of a workflow.
